#Wolfson Patchbay Mixer

A GUI utility for configuring input/output connections in a **Wolfson Pi Audio Card**.

Just drag a button with a Jack connector icon and drop it into any input connector. You can for example, drag the jack of the Line In and connect it to Line Out, or connect DMIC to the Dynamic Range Controller and then to the Headphones.

##Warning
This is still incomplete.
I just code this in my spare time. Any aportation to code will be appreciated. Any refork to make the code more Object-Oriented is welcome.
I didn't tested all outputs because I don't have all the gear required for testing like SPDIF equipment, 4-pole jack headsets or loudspeakers.

###TODO:
- Load current connections in alsamixer at opening.
- Add Volume Controls
- Add EQ inputs/outputs
- Support to the Cirrus Audio Card (for the B+ models)
